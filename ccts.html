                    Honestly, I was quite overwhealmed at first as my first assignment was nothing like I have seen before. However my lecturer, Mr Paul guided us through and gave really helpful inputs on our progress.<br><br>
                    Although this module felt cramped as it was was only 7 weeks long because it was during a short semester, I had lots of fun playing and exploring with my ideas in ways that I have never done before.
