                  Most of the TGC's have been applied throughout my experience in this module. Some of the notable TGC's are Thinking And Problem Solving Skills, Communication Skills, Interpersonal Skills and Intrapersonal Skills. All of the assignments required a lot of of creative thinking and analytical thinking to solve puzzles and come up with new ideas. On top of that, In the second assignment which is a group assignment, this assignment required a lot of coordination between the group members to come up with a well rounded idea. Besides working together as a group, we had to understand they dynamics of the group in order to spread out the work evenly based on individual skills and leadership capabilities. Digital Literacy also played a big role for me throughout this module, as observed, this e-portfolio was completely built manually using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages and has greatly improved my web development skills and programming skills.
